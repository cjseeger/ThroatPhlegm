# Throat Phlegm
Created by Chris Seeger, **Throat Phlegm** is the name of a musical group formed in Boone, Iowa during the Covid Pandemic. While they don't tour or play for public audiences, the dream remains to someday have the skill to make music, instrumental music that is. With no talent for singing, the members of **Throat Phlegm** enjoy playing guitar, bass guitar, percussion, trumpet, flute, kalimba and harmonica.

TP Guitars and TP Wood Sounds is Chris's woodworking shop that is currently in the process of building several custom instruments.
